# SignMeUp
AWS Amazon Hackathon 2018

Sign Me Up is an English to sign language translator
that takes voice input and translates it to sign
language making it easier for people to communicate
with people with hearing impairment.

How it works
✤ First phase: User records desired sentence to be
translated.
✤ Second phase: Our app sends this recording to the
Amazon server (using aws transcribe service)
✤ Third phase: The returned transcribed text from aws
transcribe is mapped to a series of corresponding sign
language GIFs and displayed to the user.


Why Sign Me Up
✤ Our application uses Signed Exact English which is an
easy to use language, simple for non signers to learn
with time using our app.
✤ It benefits both sides, because it helps people who are
hearing impaired become aware of their surroundings,
and it helps other people learn about sign language.

Anyone who is interested in learning sign language can use this app, no prior knowledge of sign
language is needed.
